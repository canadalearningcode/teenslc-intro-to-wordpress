        * the term *blog* is an abbreviation for *weblog*
        * blogs often contain an ongoing collection of time-based posts, presented in chronological order
        * often (but not always) written in a diary-style of commentary
        * a website usually contains informational pages but can also have a blog section

        Some popular blogs:
        [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/), [The Sartorialist](http://www.thesartorialist.com/), [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/), [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/)

        A CMS is an application used to edit content and manage a website using a graphical user interface rather than editing code.

        A CMS, like WordPress, may also includes features such as:

        * creating site navigation elements
        * database management
        * themes and templates for page layouts
        * making content searchable and indexable

        Logging into the WordPress admin area will automatically take you to the Dashboard. Access your Dashboard in two ways:

        **Option 1:**  Log in using your domain name and add `/wp-admin/` to the end of the URL.

        ```
        https://yoursitename.wordpress.com/wp-admin/
        ```

        **Option 2:** Log into https://wordpress.com - This will default to your **Reader**. Select **My Site > Stats**.

        #Posts

        To use WordPress for blog or time-based posts, use the **Posts** menu. Posts can also be organized into **categories** and/or **tags**.

        Note that the generated permalink includes the date.
        ![Post screenshot](framework/img/workshop/22-dashboard-posts.png)

        **Categories** allow for a broad grouping of post topics and can also contain sub-categories.

        For example, a food blog can have recipes in categories and sub-categories like so:

        ```
        Recipes:
        > Breakfast
          > Smoothies
          > Pancakes

        **Tags** are best used to create groups of content that can apply to *multiple* categories and be more specific.

        For example, a frittata recipe can have the following category and tags:

        ```xml
        Frittata recipe

        Category: Breakfast
        Tags: kid friendly, under 30mins

      When using the Visual editor, the content is automatically converted into HTML. You can also edit your own HTML using the Text editor.

      ![HTML tab screenshot](framework/img/workshop/32-editor-text.png)

      In the above example, the Text editor shows the link is surrounded by an `<a>` tag and the heading tag uses an `<h2>` like so:

      ```
      <a title="Direct link to Add New Post in your Dashboard" href="https://wordpress.com/post">start a new post</a>
      <h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
      ```

      You don't need to know any HTML to add content but it can be useful to have some basic knowledge of common HTML tags.

        #HTML Links

        HTML uses an anchor `<a>` tag for links. Wrap the tag around the word(s) that the user will click on.

        Links also require an `href` *attribute* to specify where to link to.

        A `title` *attribute* is optional but can be added to provide extra info and also appears as a "tool tip" when you hover over the link.

        ```

        #WordPress and HTML

        Paragraphs are very common in HTML documents.

        However, adding HTML into the WordPress editor is a *little* different than writing pure HTML.

        Usually, paragraphs would be written like this:

        ```html
        <p>I'm a paragraph with only one sentence.</p>

        <p>I'm another paragraph.  And I have more than one sentence! Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Ducimus molestias sequi voluptas voluptatem ipsam totam.</p>

        #Paragraphs

        In WordPress, you don't need to add `<p>` tags in the visual **or** text editor. In the visual editor, select the paragraph from the dropdown.

        ![Visual paragraph screenshot](framework/img/workshop/38-editor-visual-p.png)

        In the Text editor, just ensure you return/enter twice to add a space between the paragraphs.  They will automatically be converted into `<p>` tags via WordPress magic!

        Even though the WordPress editor doesn't require some of these specific HTML tags, you can still add them.

        The text editor will accept the `<p>`, `<br>` and other HTML tags if included. Some people may prefer to do that to have more control over the HTML formatting.

        Just note that it is not required and the visual editor can be used instead.

        We know writing takes time so feel free to use some placeholder text and images for now! (Resources at the bottom of the slide.)

        1. Add at least one page.  (e.g. About page)
        2. Add at least two blog posts with categories and tags.

        [Here's how your page may look](framework/img/workshop/exercise-content.png) (this example is still using the "Edin" theme).  Note how the different types of content appear (blog content, category, tags, etc).

        We need some content to work with for the upcoming exercises so don't worry about finding or changing your theme just yet.<!-- .element: class="note" -->

        * use your own photos
        * OR choose from some sample images [here](images.zip) (zip file)
        * OR use stock photography - here's a [list of resources](https://medium.com/@dustin/stock-photos-that-dont-suck-62ae4bcbe01b)

        * [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/web) free tool for image editing
        * [Free Image Compression tool](https://tinyjpg.com) (works for .jpg and .png files)

        You may need to resize your images. Large images may slow down your site and small images may get pixelated. We recommend sizing your "large" images around 800px wide. The filesize can also be reduced regardless of the width and height to further improve performance. <!-- .element: class="note" -->

        A WordPress **slug** is used to describe a post, page, category, or tag.

        In Posts and Pages, the slug appears in the URL and is generated automatically based on the title. It can be changed manually but it's best to keep it simple and relevant.

        Only the highlighted portion is classified as the slug and can be changed. Select the hyperlink icon to change it manually.

        A theme provides all of the graphical styles for your site.

        WordPress.com provides hundreds of themes for you to choose from so you can get a functional website without writing any code.

        Most themes include:

        * overall static page layouts & colour scheme
        * styles for blog posts and blog archives
        * typography styles
        * different types of widgets and where they are located on the page

        So why would you learn to code or pay for a theme if there are so many free, functional templates to choose from?  Well, that all depends on how *unique* and *customized* you need your site to be.

        Pre-built themes are a great way to get up and running and to try it out, and can help determine what you need before investing in development or paid themes.

        If you're not ready to code yourself just yet but want more options, paid themes often offer premium plugins, more customization options and customer support.

        **Page layout** determines the overall look and feel of your blog.  Consider how (or if) certain content is displayed such as the site title, subheading, tags, categories, main menu, etc.

        #More Advice

        [Jon Morrow](http://boostblogtraffic.com/make-money-blogging/) advises:

        If you're an independent blogger &mdash; ignore SEO (search engine optimization) for the first year. When your blog is new, the most efficient uses of your time fall into three broad categories:

        - Building relationships with influencers (including guest blogging)
        - Creating content worth linking to
        - Selling your products and services

        If you do these well, you'll get search traffic without doing anything.

        # Group exercise: Finding a Niche (20mins)

        For this exercise, practice finding a niche for your blog by brainstorming and doing some research.

        1. In groups of 2 or 3, narrow your given niche.
        1. Do some research online and come up with a micro-niche that has not yet been covered. Get specific!
        (e.g. Tennis for weight loss, Canadian fashion for women)

        > Share your micro-niche with the class.

        #Understand your Audience

        Having a clear understanding of your target audience is key! Consider what you know about your target audience and their interests while you're coming up with a topic for your blog post.

        * What do they want to know about?
        * What will resonate with them?
        * What are their interests?
        * How can you bring value to your readers?
        * What problem can you solve for them?

        #Capture Their Attention

        Grab your reader’s attention in the intro.

        Tell a story or a joke, be empathetic, or grip the reader with an interesting fact or statistic. Then describe the purpose of the post and explain how it will address a problem the reader may be having.

        Use the journalism model of the “inverted pyramid.” Start with the content that is most important to your audience, and then provide additional details.

          <p>Have you ever wondered how you would survive if you found yourself alone in the wilderness? How would you defend yourself against predators? What would you eat? Where would you find water?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
          <p>“What am I doing wrong?” I whispered to the computer screen. A part of me wanted nothing more than to go to bed and forget about blogging forever. And yet, there I was, hunched over the computer, as I dug through my traffic stats for the millionth time. Somewhere inside was the answer to why I wasn’t getting more traffic, and I was going to find it.</p>

        #Organize Your Content

        Organize the info to make it digestible and easy to read. Chunk content to make it scannable. Break up long paragraphs or using lists.

        #Coming Up with Great Topics

        1. Choose a working title for your blog post - you can always refine your title later.
        1. Develop a blog post outline &mdash; Write down all the things you want your readers to get out of the article - brain dump!
        1. Take that jumble of ideas and place them into sections (some suggest 3-4 sections as a benchmark).
        1. Add more takeaways to some sections.
        1. Revise, remove, and reorganize details in each section - reorganize the information to tell the most logical story.
        1. Spruce up the outline with any additional details, anecdotes or information that you don't want to forget while writing.

        # Create an Editorial Calendar

        Set a schedule. Categorize your content into genres like:

        * &bull; event announcements
        * &bull; new product release
        * &bull; how-to pieces
        * &bull; notable interviews

        Publish minimum 1 post per week & plan it in advance.

        Use tools like Google Calendar or a spreadsheet. The <!-- .element: class="footnote" -->[Editorial Calendar Wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/editorial-calendar/) makes it possible to see all your posts and drag and drop them to manage your blog (But reminder, plugins are only available in self-hosted Wordpress sites.)

        # The Power of Images & Video

        Visual appeal is crucial. In addition to breaking up you content into lists and digestable chunks, use images or infographics to visually represent ideas in the content.

        Some options in WordPress are:

        * image galleries
        * static images
        * feature image

        # Search Engine Optimization

        SEO works to boost visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine's unpaid results, often referred to as "natural," "organic," or "earned" results.

        Higher search rankings = more traffic

        Keywords are key! The best keywords have:

        * Strong relevance: terms for which you have content to support
        * Relatively high search volume: terms people actually search for
        * Relatively low competition: terms with small number of search results

        # SEO Keywords

        Think about your keywords as search terms &mdash; how would someone looking for information on this topic search for it? Brainstorm!

        Be specific! Instead of broad terms like “shoes” focus on “wedding shoes,” “pink suede ballerina flats” or “black patent leather high-heeled pumps.”

        Use keywords and phrases in your web content that make it possible for people to find your site via search engines.

        Link SEO keywords to relevant pages and blog posts in the series.

        # SEO Tips for Multimedia

        Search engines can’t “read” anything other than plain old text.

        Place appropriate keywords throughout your site: titles, content, URLs and image file names.

        Give file names clear, descriptive names.

        Don’t forget to add more descriptive text (or meta data) to the “alt” attribute in the image tag (which also helps for web accessability).
