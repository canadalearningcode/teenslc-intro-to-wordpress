      ##Instructor Notes

      ##Ladies Learning Code: Intro to WordPress

      <br>
      #Schedule

      <strong> Important note:</strong>
      This is a guideline, not a rule! It is more important that the learners are following along then it is to get to the end of the slides!

      <em>Please note</em>: this schedule is for a single day workshop.
      If you are leading two weekday evenings, you can split this schedule up accordingly. Please remember to take a 15-30 minute break on both days. The first 15-20 minutes of the second day should be allocated for review and questions from the prior session.

      * <strong>Getting Started (10:00 am - 11:00 am)</strong>: Mentor intros, Blog vs. Website, CMS, WordPress, Dashboard
      * <strong>Menu Options (11:00 am - 12:30 pm)</strong>: Setting profile, site settings, theme support, adding content
      * <strong>Lunch! (12:30 pm - 1:30 pm)</strong>
      * <strong>Posts (1:30 pm -2:00 pm)</strong>: post options, categories & tags, group brainstorm, editor, images & text, HTML
      * <strong>Themes (2:00 pm - 2:30 pm)</strong>: choosing a theme, customizing theme
      * <strong>Part Two (2:30 pm - 3:30 pm)</strong>: custom menus, tips & tricks, intro to blog writing, finding a niche, monetization
      * <strong>Writing Tips & Tricks (3:30 pm - 4:00 pm)</strong>: Composing posts, promotion, SEO, next steps

      <br>
      #General Notes

      * <strong>Important!</strong> Please give learners enough time to download learner files from slide 1 and create an account with wordpress.com - check in as people are entering the room and encourage them to ask yourself or a mentor for help with set-up!
      * A common issue with leaner files - make sure Windows users extract the folder. If a learner sees the slides without any styles, that is probably why.

      #Specific Examples

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <strong>Slide 4: Course Outline</strong>
        Scroll down after the table of contents to show them the example website that they will have at the end of the workshop.
        Ask if anyone has a blog already on Tumblr, Blogger, or any other platform.
        Ask for a show of hands of how many people have an idea of what they want to blog about, and encourage them to challenge that idea a bit today and try to refine it.

      <strong>Slide 5: Blog vs Website</strong>
        Pause to ask the question at the bottom of this slide. Encourage contributions from the class.

      <strong>Slide 7: Content Management System (CMS)</strong>
        Before we dive into WordPress in the next slide, think about other popular CMSs you've heard of or have experience using yourself.

      <strong>Slide 9: WordPress.com vs WordPress.org</strong>
        May want to breifly explain what hosting is. I like to refer to it as a place to pay rent for your files. Good time to differentiate the difference between a domain and hosting. They are often confused for one another.

      <strong>Slide 11: The Dashboard</strong>
        The Dashboard can be an intimidating place to get thrown into! Start from the top left and work your way around the page. Walk them through what stats would appear if they had any site traffic. Show them how to toggle through time buttons above the graph. Give a high overview of the left menu. Then turn your attention to the top right to edit profile, logout or quick write.

      <strong>Slide 16: View your site</strong>
        Practice going between the Dashboard and site in another tab with them. Try to discourage having 20 tabs open to avoid confusion.

      <strong>Slide 18: Theme support</strong>
        Think of an example of a content type that may or may not display depending on the theme selected. Eg. Featured images, category listing

      <strong>Slide 22: Publish Options</strong>
        Take the time to explain why/when each situation is helpful. Eg if you are maintaining this blog with a team, you may follow some internal review process before publishing a document.

      <strong>Slide 32</strong>
        Ask if the difference between Featured Image and images within a post is clear. If not, ask if any learners can guess what the difference is.

      <strong>Slide 49: Choosing a Theme</strong>
        Underscore how important it is to have a responsive theme. More traffic comes from mobile phones then desktop/laptop users

      <strong>Slide 58: Create a Custom Menu</strong>
        Show them how to add at least 1 external link to the menu that is not a social media property, like a Patreon account or an online shop

      <strong>Slide 71: Types of Bloggers</strong>
        Ask by show of hands who puts themselves in the categories listed. Read the article linked at the bottom of the slides yourself and give them a summary.

      <strong>Slide 73: How do you monetize a blog?</strong>
        Premium content = bonus videos, tips & tools
        Communities = Private Facebook groups, forums

      <strong>Slide 81: Organize your content</strong>
        This is an important point to drive home - people don't like to read large blocks of text on the web. Short paragraphs, subheadings and lists are key

      <strong>Slide 87: Create an Editorial Calendar</strong>
        Go back to WordPress to show how they can save posts as drafts and schedule them to automatically publish on a given date and time.

      <strong>Slide 89: Create an Editorial Calendar</strong>
        Show how they can embed a YouTube or Vimeo video in their post

      <strong>Slide 91: Promote Your Blog</strong>
        Remind them that with shameless self promotion you have nothing to loose! Put yourself out there, try to connect with bloggers you follow and if it doesn't work out, it's not something to get hung up on.
