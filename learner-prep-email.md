Thanks for registering for our upcoming WordPress workshop! We are so excited to have you come learn with us! No need to print a ticket - we'll check you in at the door. Reminder: this workshop is BYOL so be sure to bring your laptop and power cord. This workshop will focus on blog writing techniques and using WordPress.com so the only software you need is an updated, modern web browser. See more information at http://browsehappy.com/ That's it!
